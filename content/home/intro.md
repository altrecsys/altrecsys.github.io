The AltRecSys Workshop on Alternative, Unexpected, and Critical Ideas in Recommendation
will be held at [RecSys 2024](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys24/) in Bari, Italy.

> What are the vital questions, needs, or opportunities the RecSys community is currently overlooking?

This is a discussion-oriented workshop to bring together RecSys community
members interested in discussing this question, prompted by perspectives in a
variety of formats. See the [Call for Opinions](call/) for details on submitting
your ideas. Accepted contributions will be distributed through a portfolio on
this web site and used to plan and seed the discussions in the workshop.
