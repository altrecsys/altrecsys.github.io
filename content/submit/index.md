The AltRecSys workshop provides a venue to discuss interesting, preliminary, offbeat, unexpected, and critical ideas in recommender systems that do not (yet) fit well into the kinds of publications and formats for the main conference or traditional workshops.

AltRecSys aims to serve as a collaborative forum where researchers, (industry) practitioners, and other associated stakeholders can exchange ideas and together identify areas of study and new questions to expand the discussions and research agendas of the RecSys community in future years. To that end, we invite contributions responding to the following theme:

“What are the vital questions, needs, or opportunities the RecSys community is currently overlooking?”

Remember that AltRecSys not meant to be a platform to disseminate the latest research advances in the RecSys area. 
Instead, fitting contributions to this workshop may include, but are not limited to:
- Interesting and/or provocative ideas in the recommendation space that are too preliminary for a research paper but would benefit from community discussion.
- Lessons learned from negative results, failed experiments, and other outcomes that yield potentially useful and/or interesting insights into recommender systems research or practice.
- Perspectives that document and question foundational assumptions that are often taken for granted in RecSy's work.
- Methods-only research descriptions, to provoke discussion about proposed research designs before they are carried out or results are known.

We invite two forms of submissions:
- Extended abstracts of up to 500 words describing the perspective or idea.
- Short videos of up to 3 minutes.
Submissions will be editorially reviewed to curate a set of abstracts and videos that will prompt a diverse and vibrant discussion in the workshop
